**Module:** 6CSEF005W – Wireless Network Security  
**Student Name:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** [DD/MM/YYYY]  
**Assessment Type:** Lab-based wireless security audit  

---

### Executive Summary

Briefly summarise your findings, vulnerabilities identified, and the overall risk level of the wireless environment tested.

---

### 1. Scope and Objectives

- Define the network/SSID tested
- Outline what was in-scope and out-of-scope
- Describe the goals of this penetration test (e.g., handshake capture, phishing, AP impersonation)

---

### 2. Reconnaissance

- Tools used: `airodump-ng`, `iwlist`, `Wireshark`
- SSIDs and BSSIDs discovered
- Channels used
- Encryption types observed

*Insert screenshot of beacon frame/probe request if available*

---

### 3. Exploitation Activities

| Activity | Tool Used | Result |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| WEP attack | `aircrack-ng`, `aireplay-ng` | [Success/Fail – WEP key cracked] |
| WPA2 handshake | `airodump-ng`, `aireplay-ng` | [Captured handshake] |
| WPA2 crack | `aircrack-ng`, `hashcat`, `cowpatty` | [Success/Fail] |
| Evil Twin | `hostapd`, `Ghost Phisher` | [Portal launched, credentials harvested] |
| DNS spoof | `dnsmasq` | [Redirected clients] |
| Captive portal | `nodogsplash`, OpenWRT | [Page loaded, creds saved] |

*Include screenshots of credentials.txt, cracked key, etc.*

---

### 4. Analysis and Risk Assessment

Summarise each successful attack:

- Vulnerability exploited
- Risk level (High, Medium, Low)
- Potential impact (e.g., credential theft, data exfiltration)

---

### 5. Recommendations

| Vulnerability | Recommendation |
|---------------|----------------|
| WEP encryption | Upgrade to WPA3 or disable WEP |
| Open APs | Use captive portal with authentication |
| Fake portals | Educate users + implement HSTS/HTTPS |
| WPA2 brute-force | Use strong, long passphrases |

---

### 6. Appendix

- PCAP file names
- Wordlist used
- Tool versions
- Test network configuration
- Time and duration of testing
